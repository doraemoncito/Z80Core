= Z80Core: a Z80 core written in Java.

This core is a slightly modified core extracted from https://github.com/jsanchezv/JSpeccy[JSpeccy], ready to be used in any emulator that needs a Z80 CPU.

This code emulates the Z80 CPU full instruction set including:

* Undocumented instructions as SLL.
* Undocumented flags 3 & 5 from F register.
* Hidden register MEMPTR (known as WZ in official Zilog documentation).
* Strict execution order for every instruction.
* Precise timing for all instructions, totally decoupled from the core

An example that executes the CP/M v2.2 tests ZEXALL & ZEXDOC is included as a use case.

Compile the *standard* Java test application with:

    mvn clean install

Run with:

    ./exerciser/target/z80exerciser.jar

[NOTE]
--
You'll need graalvm to compile the native version of the application
--

Compile the *native* Java test application with:

    mvn clean install -Pnative

Run with:

    ./exerciser/target/z80exerciser
